## Modified Demo Script
In 24 hours, with no prior experience in app development, we learned to use Swift and XCode to create an iOS app for solving the troubles of living with roommates. In the limited time, we chose to focus on delivering the key feature of anonymous alerts as this is the functionality no other roommate app on the market has. 

Upon logging in, the app will prompt you to join or create a new room. When you create a new room, a 4 digit code is generated and displayed in your profile to share with your roommates.

As for our anonymous alert feature, this version allows you to send a notification to a roommate to lower their volume without them knowing who complained.
